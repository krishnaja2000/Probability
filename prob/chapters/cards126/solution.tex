The sample size 
\begin{align}
S=144
\end{align}
The number of bad pens is 
\begin{align}
B=20
\end{align}
The probability that she doesn't buy a pen is 
\begin{align}
\pr{B} = \frac{B}{S} &= \frac{20}{144}
\\
&= \frac{5}{36}
\end{align}
The probability that she buys a pen is 
\begin{align}
\pr{G} = 1-\pr{B} = \frac{31}{36}
\end{align}
